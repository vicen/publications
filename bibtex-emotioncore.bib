abstract = {Identifying emotions from text is crucial for a variety of real world tasks. We describe Emotion-Core, an Open-Source framework for training, evaluating, and showcasing textual Emotion Detection models. Our framework is composed of two components: Emotion Classification and EmotionUI, which allow researchers to easily extend and reuse existing emotion detection solutions. We discuss the potential impact of our software project, including a recent publication in the findings of the International conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2021). Our code is available and free to use for interested researchers.}
