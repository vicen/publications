 DOI={10.1609/icaps.v34i1.31468},
 abstractNote={The challenge in combined task and motion planning (TAMP) is the effective integration of a search over a combinatorial space, usually carried out by a task planner, and a search over a continuous configuration space, carried out by a motion planner. Using motion planners for testing the feasibility of task plans and filling out the details is not effective because it makes the geometrical constraints play a passive role. This work introduces a new interleaved approach for integrating the two dimensions of TAMP that makes use of sketches, a recent simple but powerful language for expressing the decomposition of problems into subproblems. A sketch has width 1 if it decomposes the problem into subproblems that can be solved greedily in linear time. In the paper, a general sketch is introduced for several classes of TAMP problems which has width 1 under suitable assumptions. While sketch decompositions have been developed for classical planning, they offer two important benefits in the context of TAMP. First, when a task plan is found to be unfeasible due to the geometric constraints, the combinatorial search resumes in a specific subproblem. Second, the sampling of object configurations is not done once, globally, at the start of the search, but locally, at the start of each subproblem. Optimizations of this basic setting are also considered and experimental results over existing and new pick-and-place benchmarks are reported.},

    abstract = "{Political conflict is an essential element of democratic systems, but can also threaten their existence if it becomes too intense. This happens particularly when most political issues become aligned along the same major fault line, splitting society into two antagonistic camps. In the 20th century, major fault lines were formed by structural conflicts, like owners vs workers, center vs periphery, etc. But these classical cleavages have since lost their explanatory power. Instead of theorizing new cleavages, we present the FAULTANA (FAULT-line Alignment Network Analysis) pipeline, a computational method to uncover major fault lines in data of signed online interactions. Our method makes it possible to quantify the degree of antagonism prevalent in different online debates, as well as how aligned each debate is to the major fault line. This makes it possible to identify the wedge issues driving polarization, characterized by both intense antagonism and alignment. We apply our approach to large-scale data sets of Birdwatch, a US-based Twitter factchecking community and the discussion forums of DerStandard, an Austrian online newspaper. We find that both online communities are divided into two large groups and that their separation follows political identities and topics. In addition, for DerStandard, we pinpoint issues that reinforce societal fault lines and thus drive polarization. We also identify issues that trigger online conflict without strictly aligning with those dividing lines (e.g. COVID-19). Our methods allow us to construct a time-resolved picture of affective polarization that shows the separate contributions of cohesiveness and divisiveness to the dynamics of alignment during contentious elections and events.}",

 abstractNote={Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods can successfully solve a wide range of sequential decision problems. However, learning policies that can generalize predictably across multiple tasks in a setting with non-Markovian reward specifications is a challenging problem. We propose to use successor features to learn a set of local policies that each solves a well-defined subproblem. In a task described by a finite state automaton (FSA) that involves the same set of subproblems, the combination of these local policies can then be used to generate an optimal solution without additional learning. In contrast to other methods that combine local policies via planning, our method asymptotically attains global optimality, even in stochastic environments.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Gender differences in the use of educational environments and social media platforms have been a topic of interest in research. Several studies have examined the disparities between female and male participants in terms of participation, engagement, and motivations in either educational or social media platforms. On this end, this study proceeds to explore gender disparities in an innovative educational environment that sees the incorporation of an educational component within a simulated social media environment. Objectives Driven by a dual objective, this study aims to first investigate the impact of gender on skills development in an educational social media platform, and second, to explore the behavioural differences between female and male adolescents social interactions within the platform. Methods The study involved 142 high school students in Barcelona and utilised an ad-hoc questionnaire to assess students' skills. To explore students' behaviour within the platform, actions such as likes, comments, publishing, visiting profiles, and viewing images, were recorded using the Experience API. Results and Conclusions Our study's findings indicate that both female and male students benefited from the intervention implemented within the educational social media platform. Moreover, the results revealed distinct interaction patterns between female and male participants. These findings provide valuable insights into how adolescents of different genders interact within an educational social media platform. Additionally, the design principles outlined in this study can inform the development of future educational social media interventions that effectively engage the preferences of both genders.},

  abstract={The dynamical processes taking place on a network depend on its topology. Influencing the growth process of a network therefore has important implications on such dynamical processes. We formulate the problem of influencing the growth of a network as a stochastic optimal control problem in which a structural cost function penalizes undesired topologies. We approximate this control problem with a restricted class of control problems that can be solved using probabilistic inference methods. To deal with the increasing problem dimensionality, we introduce an adaptive importance sampling method for approximating the optimal control. We illustrate this methodology in the context of formation of information cascades, considering the task of influencing the structure of a growing conversation thread, as in Internet forums. Using a realistic model of growing trees, we show that our approach can yield conversation threads with better structural properties than the ones observed without control.}

 abstractNote={ &lt;p&gt; This paper presents a novel method for controlling teams of unmanned aerial vehicles using Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) theory. The approach consists of a centralized high-level planner that computes optimal state trajectories as velocity sequences, and a platform-specific low-level controller which ensures that these velocity sequences are met. The planning task is expressed as a centralized path-integral control problem, for which optimal control computation corresponds to a probabilistic inference problem that can be solved by efficient sampling methods. Through simulation we show that our SOC approach (a) has significant benefits compared to deterministic control and other SOC methods in multimodal problems with noise-dependent optimal solutions, (b) is capable of controlling a large number of platforms in real-time, and (c) yields collective emergent behaviour in the form of flight formations. Finally, we show that our approach works for real platforms, by controlling a team of three quadrotors in outdoor conditions. &lt;/p&gt; },

abstract="In the 2010 decade, Spanish politics have transitioned from bipartidism to multipartidism. This change led to an unstable situation which eventually led to the rare scenario of two general elections within six months. The two elections had a mayor difference: two important left-wing parties formed a coalition in the second election while they had run separately in the first one. In the second election and after merging, the coalition lost around 1M votes, contradicting opinion polls. In this study, we perform community analysis of the retweet networks of the online campaigns to assess whether activity in Twitter reflects the outcome of both elections. The results show that the left-wing parties lost more online supporters than the other parties. Furthermore, we find that Twitter activity of the supporters unveils a decrease in engagement especially marked for the smaller party in the coalition, in line with post-electoral traditional polls.",

abstract="With the irruption of ICTs and the crisis of political representation, many online platforms have been developed with the aim of improving participatory democratic processes. However, regarding platforms for online petitioning, previous research has not found examples of how to effectively introduce discussions, a crucial feature to promote deliberation. In this study we focus on the case of Decidim Barcelona, the online participatory-democracy platform launched by the City Council of Barcelona in which proposals can be discussed with an interface that combines threaded discussions and comment alignment with the proposal. This innovative approach allows to examine whether neutral, positive or negative comments are more likely to generate discussion cascades. The results reveal that, with this interface, comments marked as negatively aligned with the proposal were more likely to engage users in online discussions and, therefore, helped to promote deliberative decision making.",

abstract = {Personalised medicine is a rapidly evolving field to which many resources have been devoted recently. It represents a paradigm shift from a one-size-fits-all approach to healthcare, focusing instead on tailoring treatments and diagnoses to individual patients. This study aims to contribute to this transition by leveraging recent advancements in microbiome research. An earlier study that computed the Gut Microbiome Health Index (GMHI), a potent indicator capable of predicting disease presence with approximately 70% of accuracy, serves as the foundation for this research. Positive values of the GMHI are associated with healthy subjects and negative values to non-healthy ones. The objective of this study is twofold: firstly, to advance the use of the GMHI through the application of two distinct machine learning techniques, a Fully Connected Neural Network and an Autoencoder, secondly, to adapt the GMHI for a unique dataset of COVID-19 patients. The employment of these two neural network architectures facilitated an enhancement in predictive accuracy to approximately 74.5%, surpassing the GMHI baseline accuracy of 70.95%. Simultaneously, the application of the GMHI, recalibrated using species specifically identified in the COVID-19 dataset, demonstrated a substantial increase in accuracy by 17% (achieving an accuracy of 76%). These promising results in distinguishing COVID-19 patients, highlight the potential and broad applicability of this approach in the sphere of personalized medicine and directly relating the COVID-19 disease to one’s microbiome and its composition.}

abstract = {Ranking models are typically designed to optimize some measure of immediate utility to the users. As a result, they have been unable to anticipate an increasing number of undesirable long-term consequences of their proposed rankings, from fueling the spread of misinformation and increasing polarization to degrading social discourse. Can we design ranking models that anticipate the consequences of their proposed rankings and are able to avoid the undesirable ones? In this paper, we first introduce a joint representation of rankings and user dynamics using Markov decision processes. Then, we show that this representation greatly simplifies the construction of consequential ranking models that trade off theimmediate utility and the long-term welfare. In particular, we can obtain optimal consequential rankings by applying weighted sampling on the rankings provided by models that maximize measures of immediate utility. However, in practice, such a strategy may be inefficient and impractical, specially in high dimensional scenarios. To overcome this, we introduce an efficient gradient-based algorithm to learn parameterized consequential ranking models that effectively approximate optimal ones. We illustrate our methodology using synthetic and real data gathered from Reddit and show that our consequential rankings may mitigate the spread of misinformation and improve the civility of online discussions.}
